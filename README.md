## General Information

This repository contains all the commands used in this project, still under development, which is committed to centralizing and organizing supernovae data in a data lake, using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The [utility package](https://github.com/Pletora-Data-Solutions/Glue-DataLake-Utility-Package) used in the project is available for consultation.

We are currently living in the age of precision cosmology, a time when the amount of observational data available to scientists is growing exponentially. This growth is being driven by large collaborations such as the James Webb Telescope and the Large Synoptic Space Telescope, which are capable of collecting vast amounts of high-quality data from across the universe. 
 
To sustain this large amount of observational data, modern cosmology is heavily reliant on cloud architectures and big data tools. These tools are capable of handling the sheer volume of data generated by these instruments and processing them into meaningful insights that help us better understand the universe. 
 
To further the reach of these great international collaborations, it is important to have a normalized and unified cosmological/astrophysical observations data lake. Such a data lake would make it easier for researchers from all over the globe to access and use this valuable data. By facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing, we can unlock even more insights into the mysteries of the universe and continue to advance our understanding of cosmology and astrophysics.

## Technologies Used

* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  * [AWS Glue 3.0](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/)
    * [Job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html)
    * [Crawler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-crawler.html)
  * [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/)
  * [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)
  * [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)
  * [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
* [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
    * [PySpark - Spark 3.1](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/)
* [SQL](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

We initially used Databricks to develop AWS Glue Jobs and then, with them, we can manipulate the Data Lake in Amazon S3 and query tables in Amazon Athena, using Python/PySpark and SQL. While Databricks is used for developing AWS Glue Jobs. In the end, it will be possible to deploy machine learning, from Amazon SageMaker, and create a Data Warehouse, from Amazon Redshift, to create dashboards.
